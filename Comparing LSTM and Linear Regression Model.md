Comparing LSTM and Linear Regression Models:

LSTM Model:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.
Suitable for sequence prediction tasks where the data has a temporal or sequential structure.
Can capture long-term dependencies in the data.
Requires more computational resources and data compared to linear regression.
Can handle complex patterns in the data but may be prone to overfitting.

Linear Regression Model:

Simple linear regression is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Assumes a linear relationship between input features and output.
Less computationally intensive compared to LSTM.
Suitable for tasks where the relationship between variables is approximately linear.

Selecting Best Model for Task 3:
For Task 3 - Serving predictions on a web interface using Flask, the choice of model depends on various factors such as:

Complexity of the data and task.
Resource constraints.
Real-time requirements.
Model performance.

Given the task of serving predictions on a web interface using Flask, where real-time performance and simplicity may be important, a linear regression model may be preferred due to its simplicity, lower computational requirements, and faster inference time.
